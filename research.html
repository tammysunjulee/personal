          Mandated Paternity Leave and Fertility: Evidence from South Korea

      <p class="abstract"> As more women pursue both career and family, policymakers face the challenge of boosting fertility without undermining female labor force participation. One promising lever is paternity leave, yet its effects on fertility remain underexplored. This study analyzes a 2017 corporate mandate in South Korea requiring one month of fully paid paternity leave for all male employees. Using administrative data and an event study design, we find that the mandate sharply increased leave uptake, with additional effects on longer leave-taking and spillovers to uncovered fathers through greater use of federal leave. The policy raised the annual probability of having a child by 1.4 percentage points from a pre-policy average of 9.5%, representing a 15% increase and roughly 1,459 additional births over six years. Relative to Korea’s national fertility rate during the same period, this amounts to an 8.9% increase. Effects are concentrated in dual-earner households and grow with wives’ earnings and tenure, while women’s employment does not decline. Survey evidence shows that men at treated firms report more supportive workplace culture, greater childcare involvement, and stronger fertility intentions. Together, the results indicate that mandating paternity leave can raise fertility without reducing women’s employment, by changing expectations around fathers’ caregiving and easing time constraints in dual-earner households.</p>

      <p class="abstract">While existing literature highlights the career costs of childbearing as a potential contributor to low fertility in high-income countries, few empirical studies investigate how women form beliefs about these costs and whether such beliefs shape their fertility decisions. Using a sample of South Korean female workers aged 19 to 40 years, we conduct an online survey to examine the relationship between the individuals' beliefs about the career costs of children and their family formation plans. We also execute an information provision experiment to assess how objective information about the likelihood of women working post-childbirth leads to changes in beliefs and family formation plans. We find that female respondents hold pessimistic expectations about their own post-childbirth employment, partly because they underestimate the extent to which mothers in Korea remain in the workforce. These pessimistic beliefs are strongly associated with lower fertility and marriage intentions, particularly among women with strong current career prospects and higher incomes. Information provision leads to only modest changes in intentions, as many respondents interpret higher maternal employment as reflecting financial necessity rather than improved work–family compatibility. Overall, the study underscores the importance of beliefs—and their interpretation—in shaping family formation decisions.

          Family-Friendly Firms and the Motherhood Penalty

        <p class="abstract"> Do workplace amenities mitigate the motherhood penalty? Linking matched employer–employee administrative data with hand-collected information on workplace amenities for 962 Korean firms, we document substantial heterogeneity in motherhood penalties across companies. We find that women initially employed at family-friendly firms are more likely to remain in the labor market after childbirth, while those at less supportive firms tend to exit rather than switch to more accommodating employers. Using a machine learning–based causal forest approach, we further show that flexible work arrangements, onsite childcare, and remote work options are the amenities most strongly associated with smaller post-birth declines in employment and earnings. These findings highlight the importance of workplace institutions that enable work–family compatibility in retaining female talent and narrowing gender gaps in career progression.

        Unconditional Cash Transfers and Youth Labor Supply: Evidence from South Korea <span class="meta">(with Jungmin Lee and Sohee Jeon)</span>
        <!-- <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ## TITLE ##</a>-->
      </div>
      <p class="abstract">This paper examines how unconditional income support affects labor supply among financially dependent young adults. We study a UCT in Seongnam, South Korea that provided 1 million KRW ($\simeq$19\% of annual earnings) in four quarterly payments to all 24-year-olds. Using administrative panel data and a difference-in-differences design comparing eligible youth in Seongnam with same-age cohorts in nearby cities, we find short-run reductions in labor supply: quarterly earnings fall by about 2\% and the probability of employment declines by 0.7 percentage points, driven almost entirely by fewer part-time jobs. The implied labor-supply elasticities are −0.12 with respect to individual earnings and −0.37 with respect to household income. These effects dissipate once payments end, and we detect no dicernible changes in employment or total earnings in three years after the transfer period. Overall, the program induces a temporary income effect without longer-run gains or losses in labor-market outcomes.
